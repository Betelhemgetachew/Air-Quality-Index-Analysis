## Analyzing Global Air Quality Index (AQI) Data

This project involves analyzing air quality index (AQI) data from various cities around the world.
The goal is to identify trends, compare air quality across different regions, and investigate the
impact of certain events (like holidays, wildfires, or policy changes) on air quality. The project
will use Python's pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization,
and possibly sklearn for some basic predictive modeling
