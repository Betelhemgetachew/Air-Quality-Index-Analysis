## Analyzing Global Air Quality Index (AQI) Data
### Overview
This project analyzes air quality index (AQI) data from cities around the world to identify trends, compare air quality across regions, and investigate the impact of significant events (like holidays and wildfires) on air quality. The project employs Python's pandas for data manipulation and uses matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

### Features  
- Data Collection: Access AQI data from OpenAQ.
- Data Exploration: Summary statistics and comparative analysis of AQI across cities.
- Visualization: Create visualizations to represent AQI trends and differences.
- Predictive Modeling: Optional predictive modeling using sklearn.
### Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (optional)
